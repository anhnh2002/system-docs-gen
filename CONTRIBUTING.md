## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 80 character line length
* Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
* Use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting.
* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines.
* Use snake_case for variable and function names.
* Use PascalCase for class names.
* Write docstrings for all public modules, classes, functions, and methods using Google style.
* Use type hints for function signatures.
* Keep imports organized: standard library first, then third-party libraries, then local application/library specific imports, each group separated by a blank line. Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to automate this.
